# Walktober intro
- Get to version of distribution input that is good
  - What the hell do I do with this
  - Could plot estimates over time, but then what was the point in doing all that pedometer research?
- How do we want to integrate this information?
- Lets put a pin in this and come back to it.

  - Nice statistical properties are what separate us from the animals


# Criteria 1: Signal Supression
- Statistical validity translates to perceptual ease
- Like a
